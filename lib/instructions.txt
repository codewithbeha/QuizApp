//ReadMe file Explore what i do in this app.

before we go to design ui let make some constant variables
- create a seperate file.

-lets create our home page.

-lets delete all the default code and start from scratch.

  -lets start work on UI.
  -change background color and the appBar first.
  -import the constats.dart to home page because it has out colors.

  -lets add some questions.

  - now let create our questions widget.
  -lets add it to our homepage.
  -with that our question widget is ready.

  -im going to build 'Next Question' button.
  -add it to floating action button.
  -lets add some fuctions to button.
  -like when we click next question will show.
  -to do it we need to pass total question number and the index to it. //we need to pass a function which make all work.
  - we have an error becuase when i click button twice it change from 1 to 2. in list we have only 2 question (0,1) so it didnt the third.
  -to fix that add some conditions.
  -it fixed.

  -now lets setting the button.
    - lets create our costum widget for opstion.
    - lets add it to homescreen.
    -make it clickable.
    -we need to change color when is clickd.
    -now that cheating we cant let user know answers . lets us some condistions about it.
    -if user click then change the color other wise no.
    -we need to put a function to know where isPressed values.
    -now here is another problem when isPressed the nextQuestion the colors shows like before is unchanged the isPressed.
    -lets fix it we do it in 'nextQuestion' function. 
    -now is fixed let's go for other part.

    - now there is a little problem. when user click next page he go in next page we dont want that we want if user dont select
    any we want to show a message if he want to contiune need a click. lets fix.
    -the up problem is fixed.

     -lets go for another one.
     -lets add some score to show in our app.
     -lets give some functions our score.
     -when the user answer is currectly of a question then the score go up other wise no.
     -//lets remove the gesture detector from inside optioncard and put it into parent widget.
      -and thats a problem it increases even thought the user already selected once.
     -lets fix it. to checkAnswerAndUpdate make a condictions and isAlreadySelected = true
     -let's make it's value to false on nextQuestion isAlreadySelected = false;
  - finish for now is fine lets go.

  -part 8
  -alright everything looks good so far but, i want to change something
  you see when the color of our optioncard changes the Text on the area is a little 
  hard to read.
  i want to make it so when the color changes the color of our text will change too.
  -HOW IT work
  -code of two colors 
  -these two colors have same combinations of blue;
  -so if the color we provide here doesnt have the same combination of red,
  and green then its the neutral color we created before , and the text color
  will become black and if the red and green are same then its either red or green color 
  to sum it up it darker color the its gona display our neutral color .

  -sorry if you got confused play with colors and u will get it.

  part 9
  -now lets create a result box at the end of our quiz. it's gona show the 
  result of user.
  -lets create our dialog box in a separate file.
  -that's are our result box.

  part 10
  -now lets add a button to start the quiz from start.
  -//now we need a fuction to do the work
  -//we will create that in the home screen.dart
  -we have another problem we cant select wrong question.
  it is fixed now. 

  part 11 connectiong to a database.
  
  -let's start working in database. go to 'firebase.google.com'
  -you have to login to use the firebase services.
  -once logged in, click on 'go to console' and then create a project.
  -once created, then click on 'realtime database'. create a database in 'test mode'.

  -let's make a separate file for database actions. 'db_connect
  -to connect to database , fire base has it's own package for flutter,
  to advanced subject so we will use the lightweight 'http' package.
  enter ' flutter pub add http' in terminal.

  -let's start creating our functions.
  -firebase understands json data so we have to convert our questions to json format.
  -to do that we use another package called 'convert' which is build in 'dart'.

  -let's try to add a question in database.
  -create an object for 'DBConnect' class in main.dart and add a question.
  -hot restart to run the main method.
  -that's how you add a question in database.

  part 12 fetch data from database
  -let's fetch the questios from the database.
  
  -use the same method we used to add questions.
  -that's how you fetch questions from the database.

  part 13 adding more questions
  -let's add some more data to database.
   - ok let's try to fetch these.
   -the function is already there. so just hot restart it.
   -so we can see the questions we added.

  part 14 Convert the data?
  - time to display the questions from our database in our app.
    - first of all , when we fetch the data from our database it's in a,
    'Map<dynamic, dynamic>' format. we have to convert it to 'Map<String, dynamic>'.

    -then we need each 'key, value' pair to a question.
    -then we need some plase to save these questions we created.
    -this error occured because our 'options' is in Map<String, dynamic> format.
    -we need that in Map<String, bool> format. -/to convert it use Map.cast method.
    (Map.castFrom)

  Part 15 

  -now we need to replace the in app questions to the questions we fetched from database.


  -with that now we are fetching the questions from database, and
  displaying to our app.

  -there you have it. the simple quiz app that fetching data from database.
  -we don't need the addQuestion method anymore.
  -but if you want add question directly from app the i have the method in comment.
  
  -now the app is done.
